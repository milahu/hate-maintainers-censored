# hate maintainers censored

conservative fucks. fuck them.

## censored

"the nix community" bullied github into censoring my repo [hate-maintainers](https://github.com/milahu/hate-maintainers) ([archive](http://web.archive.org/web/20230222134059/https://github.com/milahu/hate-maintainers)).

"kill" was the word-too-much for github, together in a sentence with the word "faggets".

now that URL says:

> This repository has been disabled.
>
> Access to this repository has been disabled by GitHub Staff due to a violation of GitHub's terms of service. Contact Support for more information or to request a review of this decision.

i have appealed the ban, but github support ignores me.

no surprise, because either github is already subverted by the woke mob,
or github is afraid of the woke mob.

## banned

> "the nix community" bullied github into censoring my repo

why? i was [banned](https://github.com/NixOS/moderation/commit/836964980e170fe6c856eb0296c27b8337309be8) from "the nix community" for "hate speech".

in my `hate-maintainers` repo,
i have archived the [discussion of my ban](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/where-can-i-find-the-context-when-a-user-is-banned/25674) ([archive 1](https://web.archive.org/web/20230222112654/https://discourse.nixos.org/t/where-can-i-find-the-context-when-a-user-is-banned/25674)) ([archive 2](https://web.archive.org/web/20230222181834/https://discourse.nixos.org/t/where-can-i-find-the-context-when-a-user-is-banned/25674)).

the discussion was censored when the discussion became "too hot",
meaning: more and more people dared to show support for my side.
(meta-censorship, censoring the process of censorship.)

its so easy to "win" a discussion, when you can censor any opposing views ...
but these people dont want to "win", they just want "peace", "order", "community", "safety", "harmony", ...
no matter how fake and fragile.

## moved

i have moved my `hate-maintainers` repo to darktea, a tor-hidden git provider.
